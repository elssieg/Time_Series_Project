_Europe's Greenhouse Gas Emissions (1990 -2014)_
This is  the final projects my teammate and I did for our Time Series class. We performed it in R.
The project is called Europeâ€™s Greenhouse Gas Emissions from 1990 - 2014. For this project we used the United Nation's Dataset in which it covered 43 countries in Europe. 
The dataset has a total of 8,406 observations and have columns such as : Country/Region, Year (1990-2014), Value (Volume of Pollutant in Kilotonnes), Category of Pollutant (CO2, NF3, SF6, CH4, N2O,
HFCS, PFCs, SF6, NF3).

For simplicity purposes, we decided to group together all of the European countries into 4 different regions: Western, Easter, Northern, and Southern Europe. All of the trends in the 4 different
regions show a downtrend. Therefore, we decided to group all of the 4 regions together. 

1. Look at the ACF and PACF
2. Perform Ljung-Box test to see if the data is independently distributed.
3. Look into different ARIMA models to see which one give us the best AIC, and BIC.
4. Perform Analysis of Residuals
5. Split data into training/testing.
5. Look into Model's results.
